Part #1 of Lab 9 is a simple formatting change to the povided code. By adding in a 'Y' variable for speed and movement the boundary box based on the Y axis and height
can then be added without it freaking out simply below. Most of the code was already provided for us by VJ.

Part #2 is a hybrid of our exit ticket, the bouncing balls and my code for the balls from Part #1. It uses an object and class to utilize 2 loops and an array in order to produce 10 balls all bouncing on the X and Y axis with constraints. The code is re-written from the original class exercise with different parameters all labeled in my comments. It does succesfully work. 

I am adding a commit to "Part #2" that has an updated with a loop that causes it to prox 50 times rather than 10 for Part #3 so the link for #2/#3 will be the same.
